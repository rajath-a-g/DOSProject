2) Implementation details:

- We have used the WebSocketSharp package,which is a prerelease version of a wrapper on the System.Net.WebSockets to implement a websocket
  interface on the server side and the client creates a seperate websocket for each of the operations(Register,Login,Logout,..).

- We have used the duplex architecture of websockets to both push and receive data on the client side.

- The Akka actor framework is used to orchestrate the whole twitter engine. The server actor has been modified to use websockets.
  The client actor now sends all its messages on the websocket interface.

- The messages sent and received are serialized into JSON format using System.Text.Json.

- The errors are handled at two levels- 1) websocket errors - the websocket interface provides the OnError handler, which we 
					display to the clients.
					2) twitter engine errors - this is included as a status in the response object as "Success"
					or "Failed" for all requests.

- The websocket interface can be used with other frameworks, which support websockets like python, javascript,etc.
